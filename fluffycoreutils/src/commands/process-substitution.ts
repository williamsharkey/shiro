/**
 * process-substitution - Helper for process substitution
 *
 * Process substitution is a shell feature that treats command output as a file:
 *   diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
 *   command > >(tee log.txt)
 *
 * This helper command assists shells in implementing process substitution.
 * The shell should:
 * 1. Recognize <(command) and >(command) syntax
 * 2. Execute the command in a subshell
 * 3. Create a temporary file or named pipe with the output
 * 4. Replace the substitution with the file path
 * 5. Clean up temporary resources after command completes
 *
 * This command is a stub that provides guidance for shell implementers.

      stdout: `process-substitution: This is a shell language feature, not a command.

Process substitution must be implemented at the shell parser level:

Syntax:
  <(command)  # Input substitution - command output as input file
  >(command)  # Output substitution - command input as output file

Input Substitution <(command):
  diff <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)

  Shell implementation:
  1. Execute "sort file1.txt" in subshell
  2. Capture output to temporary file or named pipe
  3. Replace <(sort file1.txt) with the temp file path
  4. Run: diff /tmp/subst123 /tmp/subst124
  5. Clean up temp files after diff completes

Output Substitution >(command):
  echo "data" | tee >(process1) >(process2) > output.txt

  Shell implementation:
  1. Create named pipes or temporary files
  2. Start "process1" and "process2" in background reading from pipes
  3. Replace >(process1) with pipe paths
  4. Connect tee output to the pipes
  5. Wait for processes and clean up

Common Use Cases:
  # Compare outputs of two commands
  diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)

  # Multiple outputs
  command | tee >(grep error > errors.log) >(grep warning > warnings.log)

  # Input from multiple sources
  paste <(cut -f1 file1) <(cut -f2 file2)

  # Avoid temporary files
  while read line; do
    echo "\$line"
  done < <(find . -type f)

Implementation Steps for Shells:
1. Lexer: Recognize <( and >( as special tokens
2. Parser: Extract command from parentheses
3. Executor:
   a. For <(cmd):
      - Execute cmd, capture stdout
      - Write to temp file (or create named pipe)
      - Return path to temp file
   b. For >(cmd):
      - Create named pipe or temp file
      - Start cmd with stdin from the pipe
      - Return path to the pipe
4. Substitution: Replace in command line with file path
5. Cleanup: Remove temp files/pipes after main command exits

Browser Implementation Notes:
- Named pipes (FIFOs) aren't available in browser
- Use temporary files in virtual filesystem
- For >(cmd), write to temp file then pass to command
- Ensure proper ordering of operations

Example Pseudo-code:
  if (token matches /<\\((.+)\\)/) {
    const cmd = extractCommand(token);
    const output = await executeCommand(cmd);
    const tempPath = createTempFile(output);
    replaceToken(token, tempPath);
    scheduleCleanup(tempPath);
  }

Shell implementers: Parse at lexer/parser level, execute before main command.
